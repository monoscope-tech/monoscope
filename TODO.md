  - [] Track reqs per second and reqs per minute per month over time
  - [] Merge field format anomalies into shapes
    - [] improve anomalies UX as much as possible

  - [] click a field in log explorer. 
- [] When you log in with auth0, override the existing name and photos with the latest from auth0
- [x] Add concept of super admins who can see all projects on their platforms and who can log into any project.

#### 26/7/2022
- [x] Hash each shape, and only insert new shapes if there has been a lot of changes. Else, only the request dump is good enough. 
- [x] Introduce caching for holding the projects in memory and the list of their shapes.
  - [x] Using the cache and the hashes, prevent unnecessary db inserts, and only insert for requests that don't match existing shapes, or when we don't yet have enough examples.
- [x] map through fields and generate their hashes. Also set the endpoint hash in there

#### 12/8/2022
- [] Instead of having examples as a column under formats, could we be better served by having an examples table?
- [x] Create an onboarding screen for projects with checklist until a user has data in their dashboard.
