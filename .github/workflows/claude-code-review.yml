            Please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations, Test coverage, Security concerns. Succinctly.
            - Code succinctness is a priority, and we enable many GHC extensions that should be leveraged to write concise and succinct code so codebase doesn't grow so fast. 
            - Using the packages we have in the project is always prefered to reimplementing functions or expressions where we could have called a function from a package in our package list, or a popular maintained package from the ecosystem.
            - considering having less lines of code is a priority, and considering the packages in this project and the ghc extensions, please review this code and find improvements
